title: Around the World in 90 Days
excerpt: I circumnavigated the globe in the summer of 2011.

Right now I'm in the middle of a trip around the world. The route I'm
taking will take me across three continents: North America, Asia, and
Europe. Essentially, I'm circumnavigating the northern hemisphere.

The Route
---------

### North America

The [first stop on my trip is New Orleans](/new-orleans). I'm going to
be in New Orleans for Jazz Fest so that should be a lot of fun.

After that, I'm taking the "City of New Orleans" train up to
[Chicago](/chicago).

Then, I'm [continuing on to Boston](/boston-and-cambridge) to spend a
couple of days, and hopefully see The Feelies in concert.

From Boston, I'm taking the train to [the Grand Canyon](/grand-canyon).
(My route is really bizarre, I know.)

After the Grand Canyon, I'm [continuing on to Los
Angeles](/los-angeles).

After a few days in L.A., I'm taking the "Coast Starlight" up the West
Coast to [Seattle](/seattle).

Then I'm taking the train [to Minneapolis to visit my Minnesotan
relatives](/minneapolis-and-st-paul).

After Minneapolis, I'm heading to Chicago and then taking the
"California Zephyr" [to San Francisco, where I'll spend a week or
so](/san-francisco-and-silicon-valley).

### Asia

[My first stop in Asia will be Beijing](/beijing-and-the-great-wall). I
have to admit, my Chinese probably isn't up to par so that should be
interesting.

After Beijing, I'm taking the Trans-Siberian railway through Mongolia
and across Siberia to Moscow.

### Europe

After spending a couple days in Moscow, I'm flying to Stockholm. In
Sweden I'll visit friends and family and celebrate Midsommar.

Then, I'm traveling via Interrail for a month around Europe. The exact
itinerary isn't set in stone just yet, but some European countries I
haven't yet visited are Greece, Spain, Germany, Austria, and Belgium.

After traveling around Europe via train, I hope to finish the trip off
in Iceland (if time and money allow).

The Transportation
------------------

### North America

For the North American leg of my trip, I'm using the Amtrak Rail Pass.
Basically you get a month of train travel for around 500 bucks.

As I write this, I'm sitting on an Amtrak train to New Orleans. Every
Amtrak train has its own name -- the one I'm on right now is called the
"Crescent". Everyone I've talked to says that traveling on Amtrak has
become their new favorite mode of transportation. At this point, I'm
inclined to agree with them.

Here are some things I like about Amtrak:

-   *No security hassles* - You don't have to worry about any of the TSA
    nonsense that you're forced to endure at airports. When you arrive
    at the station, you literally just hop on the train and that's it.
-   *Lots of space* - I'm traveling in coach class right now, and it's
    fantastic. I've got 2-3 feet of legroom -- compare that with the six
    inches you get in coach class on airplanes. Plus, you're free to
    move around the train at any time, and there are lounge cars
    designed specifically for enjoying the ride.
-   *Power outlets everywhere* - There are 120V standard power outlets
    along the entire length of the train. Every seat has two power
    outlets. Although they don't have internet onboard, the power makes
    it feasible for me to use my phone for tethering internet as much as
    I want.
-   *Relaxed atmosphere* - Unlike on airplanes, where everyone is
    uptight as a result of being treated like cattle, the people on the
    train are really friendly and laid-back. It's a very humane mode of
    transportation.

### Asia

I flew from San Francisco to Beijing for about \$600. In Beijing, I used
the surprisingly modern (albeit crowded) subway system as well as the
ridiculously cheap taxis.

I then took the Trans-Siberian railroad to Moscow, via Mongolia. I
bought a first-class ticket for about \$1,300 via a British travel
agency, but if I were to do it again I would book through CIS (which is
precisely what the British travel agency did).

### Europe

In Moscow, I used the grandiose subway system. The subway stations are
like underground palaces of the proletariat, and the system is not at
all expensive (for Moscow).

I flew from Moscow to Stockholm for a couple hundred dollars. While in
Sweden, I used their excellent public transportation system, SL.

I then purchased an Interrail ticket which provides 10 days of rail
travel over a 22 day period. I took the train down to Croatia, which is
where I'm at right now.

The Gear
--------

### Bags

First, I would like to say something about bags. I have seen a ton of
people lugging about large backpacks in developed cities like Moscow and
Copenhagen. I've even seen the prototypical Eurotrippers with a large
backpack on their backpack and a supplementary one on their front. There
is absolutely no reason to do this in developed countries! Use a bag
with wheels instead - it's ridiculous how much easier it is to carry
weight thanks to the invention of the wheel.
