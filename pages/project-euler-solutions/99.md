## Question

<p>
Comparing two numbers written in index form like $2^{11}$ and $3^7$ is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that $2^{11} = 2048 \lt 3^7 = 2187$.
</p>

<p>
However, confirming that $632382^{518061} \gt 519432^{525806}$ would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.
</p>

<p>
Using <a href="http://projecteuler.net/project/base_exp.txt">base_exp.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.
</p>




## Commentary

<p>
As the question notes, it would be difficult to evaluate these exponents directly as they contain
over three million digits each. Therefore, we must find a way to reduce these exponents to a
manageable size.
</p>

<p>
To do so, we use the identity $\log{a^x} = x \times \log{a}$. Since $\log{b} \gt \log{a}$ if $ b \gt a$,
this will serve as an approximation of calculating the exponents directly.
</p>





## Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
from math import log10
largest = [0, 0]
for i, line in enumerate(open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'base_exp.txt'))):
    a, x = map(int, line.split(','))
    if x * log10(a) > largest[0]:
        largest = [x * log10(a), i+1]
print largest[1]
```


```bash
$ time python2 largest-exponent.py
real   0m0.022s
user   0m0.017s
sys    0m0.003s
```
