After traveling for a few hours on the "Lake Shore Limited", I arrived
at the train station in Boston. As usual, the first thing I did was set
off in search of a place to stay.

I found a place right next to Berklee School of Music, the HI hostel in
Boston. The hostel is situated very well; right across the bridge from
Cambridge.

After checking in, I met a guy who had found a temporary job
destroying buildings in Canada. He says it's impossible to head home 
from that job angry.

The next day at breakfast I met a student from Singapore who was 
researching [linear optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) 
at MIT using Mathematica. You tend to meet some interesting
people at breakfast in hostels.

Later, as I was walking out the door, I ran into the same guy again.
We both set off for Cambridge, philosophizing as we went. After 
touring the MIT campus and the MIT museum, he headed for the library 
of architecture, and I walked down Mass. Avenue.

Cambridge is a radical assortment of vintage clothing stores, nerdy
bars, a Communist bookstore, and an educated populace. They also have a
few universities.

I ordered some Lapsang Souchong at a tea shop on Mass. Ave., sat down
and read an old translation of the 
[*Tao Te Ching*](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm). 
That's a really interesting document by the way, if you get a chance 
to read it you should.

I continued down Mass. Ave., walking past some familiar places. In
total, I walked around 50 blocks up and down Mass. Avenue.

Eventually it was time for The Feelies to play at the Middle East, which
was the main reason I had gone to Boston. They played in a dimly-lit 
underground room to a crowd who were either 20 or 50, nothing in between.

In short, it was the best concert I've ever seen. Even though they
didn't interact with the crowd much, it was a really energetic
performance, with *four encores*! Their detached style was infinitely
preferable to The Strokes' endless meandering at Jazz Fest. The way I
see it, if you don't have anything sensible to say, you probably
shouldn't say anything.

Overall I'm glad I made the side-trip to Boston. The Feelies concert on
its own would have made it worth the time; coupled with the excellent
day in Cambridge it was awesome.

The next day I set off for the Grand Canyon.
