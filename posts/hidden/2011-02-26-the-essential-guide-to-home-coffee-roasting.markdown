Every once in a while I come across a DIY project that is both cheaper
and better than its commercial counterpart. I'm talking about things
like the [alcohol stove][], [DD-WRT][], and the [CMoy amp][]. Recently I
have added a new item to this list: home coffee roasting.

Why you should roast at home
----------------------------

You may ask why someone would want to roast coffee at home, instead of
just buying a pound or two from the store.

### It's cheaper than store-bought coffee

As I alluded to above, it's cheaper to roast your own coffee than to buy
it from the store. You can purchase 4 pounds of organic raw coffee for
20 bucks. Plus you save a trip to the store!

<h3>
It tastes better than store-bought coffee
</h3>
Furthermore, it tastes better than commercial coffee. No doubt the fact
that you have made it yourself has something to do with this, but after
trying it I'm sure you will agree.
<h3>
Complete control
</h3>
The third major advantage is control. Do you prefer lightly roasted
wet-processed organic coffee from Ethiopia? No problem. The variety of
raw coffee beans for sale is astonishing, and once you have the beans
you can roast them however you like. You can even experiment with blends
of different growing regions and roast profiles.

<h2>
Why you shouldn't roast at home
</h2>
The downside of roasting coffee at home is that it requires more effort
than purchasing coffee yourself. You will probably have to roast coffee
at least once a week. There's more to roasting coffee than just picking
a bag from the shelf and pouring it into your coffee maker. If you
consider that to be a drawback, coffee roasting may not be for you.

On the other hand, if you think that getting some of the best coffee in
the world at the cost of a little extra effort sounds like an excellent
idea, read on.
<h2>
Selecting the beans
</h2>

First and foremost, you will need something to roast. I recommend
purchasing from
<a title="Sweet Maria's" href="http://www.sweetmarias.com/">Sweet
Maria's</a>, a site which specializes in home coffee roasting. They have
an incredible selection of raw beans for sale. They also have some
samplers, which I highly recommend if you are just getting started with
coffee roasting. If you opt to purchase a sampler, you will receive
several bags of coffee selected to give you an overview of the different
tastes associated with different growing regions.

After you finish off the sampler, you will have an idea of which regions
and roasting styles you prefer. Once you know what you like, you can
make more specific purchases.
<h2>
Equipment
</h2>
As with most DIY projects, you'll need some equipment to get started.

<h3>
Roasier
</h3>
The roaster is the most important piece of equipment needed for coffee
roasting. There are a lot of choices here. For example, there are ways
to roast coffee on your stovetop and there are also a variety of
commercial offerings. However, the roaster that I recommend is actually
a popcorn popper. That's right, you can repurpose an old popcorn popper
for coffee roasting. The specific model I use is the West Bend Poppery
II. You can find these for sale on eBay or at your local thrift store.

Here's a list of popcorn poppers known to work for roasting coffee:
<ul>
    <li>
West Bend Poppery II (1200 watt model) - the one I use
</li>
    <li>
Popcorn Pumper
</li>
    <li>
Kitchen Gourmet (from Walgreens)
</li>
    <li>
Toastmaster 6203
</li>
    <li>
Presto Poplite (from Wal-mart - stock \#s 04820\*, 04821, and 114316)
</li>
    <li>
Nostalgia Brand (Bed Bath & Beyond)
</li>
    <li>
Toastess TCP-388 (also TCP-1)
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Container
</h3>
You can use any glass jar or container . Just make sure that it has a
lid which can be sealed.
<h3>
Cooling method
</h3>
You can either use a metal colander or a metal cookie sheet. The
important thing is that it will absorb heat from the hot freshly roasted
beans.
<h3>
Measuring cup
</h3>
Any 1/2 cup measuring cup will suffice.
<h2>
Method
</h2>
Roasting coffee is both an art and a science. You may not end up with
exactly what you were hoping for the first time around, but with
practice you will achieve consistent results.

While there are those who have installed thermometers and computers into
their roasters to ensure that the coffee meets their exact
specifications, this guide will take a more artistic approach.
<h3>
Select the coffee you will be using
</h3>

The first thing to do is to select the coffee you will be roasting and
how you intend to roast it. If you purchased the coffee from Sweet
Maria's, the bag will have some roasting recommendations printed on it,
such as "Cityâ€“Full City+". I typically follow these recommendations,
since the Sweet Maria's people are more knowledgeable than I am about
which coffees are best roasted lightly and which are not.

<h3>
Gather materials and set up roaster
</h3>
Gather the rest of your materials and set up your roaster somewhere
indoors. If you try to roast outside, your roaster will probably
struggle to achieve the required temperature and thus produce an
inferior result.

The roasting process produces a large amount of a flaky substance called
"chaff". It's best if you situate your roaster such that the chaff will
fall into your sink, so that you can just flush it away when finished.
<h3>
Pour a half-cup of the coffee into the roaster
</h3>
Once you've finished setting up, you will need to measure about a
half-cup of the green coffee and pour it into the roaster. It's
important not to overfill the roaster, as this will result in an uneven
roast.
<h3>
Roast until you achieve the desired roast level
</h3>
This is the part that gets a bit more interesting. In coffee roasting,
you will hear people refer to the "first crack" and "second crack".
These are terms which describe phases of the roasting process.

The first crack starts about two minutes into the roasting process. You
will know when it starts because it produces popping sounds like popcorn
in the microwave. It lasts for one to two minutes. The pops will slow
down until eventually all of the beans have "cracked". At this point,
you have achieved a "City" roast. This is the lightest roast that I
recommend.

After a minute of silence, the popping will return with renewed vigor.
This is the start of the "second crack". If you stop the roast now, you
will have a "Full City" roast.

If you keep the roast going for a minute or so, you will have a "French"
roast. Beyond this point, you get something called charcoal.
<h3>
Pour the coffee into your cooling device
</h3>

Once you have achieved the desired roast, you need to turn off the
roaster and pour the coffee beans into your cooling device. The goal is
to cool the beans as quickly as possible so that they don't continue to
roast. Just shake the beans around for a bit until they've cooled down
enough that you can touch them.

<h3>
Once cooled, store the coffee for 6-12 hours
</h3>
Pour the cooled coffee beans into your storage jar. You want to leave
the lid slightly ajar so that the coffee is able to vent gases. The
degassing period takes around 6-12 hours and it is inadvisable to drink
the coffee during this time. I usually leave the coffee overnight so
that it's ready in the morning.
<h3>
Enjoy
</h3>
If you've gotten to this point, congratulations are in order: you are
now a home coffee roaster. Time to enjoy some delicious home roasted
coffee!

Grind up the coffee, and brew it with a french press (or alternative
roasting method of choice). Fill up a mug, and if all went well, you are
now a privileged drinker of some of the best coffee in the world. Once
you've tried home roasted coffee you won't settle for anything less!
