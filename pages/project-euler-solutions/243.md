## Question

A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called a proper fraction.

For any denominator, $d$, there will be $d - 1$ proper fractions; for example, with $d = 12$:

$$\frac{1}{12}, \frac{2}{12}, \frac{3}{12}, \frac{4}{12}, \frac{5}{12}, \frac{6}{12}, \frac{7}{12}, \frac{8}{12}, \frac{9}{12}, \frac{10}{12}, \frac{11}{12}.$$

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a <em>resilient fraction</em>.

Furthermore we shall define the <em>resilience</em> of a denominator, $R(d)$, to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, $R(12) = \frac{4}{11}$.

In fact, $d = 12$ is the smallest denominator having a resilience $R(d) < \frac{4}{10}$.

Find the smallest denominator $d$, having a resilience $R(d) < \frac{15499}{94744}$.
