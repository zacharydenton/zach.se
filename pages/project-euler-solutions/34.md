## Overview


### Question

145 is a curious number, as $1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145$.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: as $1! = 1$ and $2! = 2$ are not sums they are not included.






## Solutions

### Clojure

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (or (= n 1) (= n 0)) 
    1 
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

(defn digits [number]
  (map #(- (int %) 48) (str number))) 

(defn curious? [number]
  (and (= (apply + (map factorial (digits number))) number)
       (> (count (digits number)) 1)))

(println (reduce + (filter curious? (range 50000))))
```


```
$ time clojure curious.clj
real	0m2.065s
user	0m3.914s
sys	0m0.113s
```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts (0..50000).select { |i|
	i.to_s.length > 1 && i == i.to_s.each_char.map { |d| (1..d.to_i).reduce(1, :*) }.reduce(:+)
}.reduce(:+)
```


```
$ time ruby curious.rb
real	0m0.611s
user	0m0.597s
sys	0m0.011s
```



### Scheme

```scheme
(define (factorial n)
  (apply * (iota n 1)))

(define (digits n)
  (if (zero? n)
      '()
      (cons (remainder n 10) (digits (quotient n 10)))))

(define (curious? n)
  (and (= (apply + (map factorial (digits n))) n)
       (> (length (digits n)) 1)))

(display (apply + (filter curious? (iota 50000))))
(newline)
```


```
$ time mit-scheme-native --quiet < curious.scm
real	0m2.012s
user	0m0.715s
sys	0m0.098s
```
