I was quite unlucky with my journey on the Empire Builder. The train was
already an hour behind schedule as it departed from Seattle. Then, 15 minutes 
outside of Seattle, the train crashed into a car! According to the news
reports, the car was pushed over 100 meters until it finally came to a
halt. Miraculously, the person in the car survived. Later on, we were
delayed even further by heavy freight traffic. Amtrak doesn't own the rails
it runs on, so the freight cars always get the right of way.
I ended up arriving in Minneapolis about five hours behind schedule.

I was greeted by my distant relatives upon
exiting the train in Minneapolis. So distant in fact that I wasn't
entirely sure who they were. I'm glad I met them though because
they are extremely friendly people!

They took me on a great driving tour of St. Paul and Minneapolis. 
We drove through many different neighborhoods, discussing the history
and politics of the twin cities along the way. There are some
similarities between the politics of Minnesota and the politics of
Sweden, probably due in part to the number of Minnesotans with
Scandinavian heritage. We saw the beautiful capitol building and passed
by a staggering number of universities and colleges.

We then had lunch with their oldest son, who lives in Uptown. It was a 
beautiful day, so we decided to walk along the lakeside to the Tin Fish
restaurant. Apparently a lot of other people had the same idea, because
the queue in front of the restaurant stretched all the way down to the water. We continued
on into the center of Uptown, and entered a restaurant thoughtfully named "Cafeteria".
The waitress led us up to our table on the roof, which was quite nice --
until it started raining.

After lunch, we drove back to their house. I was able to wash all four
of my shirts. I briefly met the younger
daughter and son of the family before having dinner. I noticed that the Empire
Builder which I was scheduled to take the next morning was delayed
for five hours, now leaving at noon. I went to sleep.

The next day, I woke up to find that the train had fallend even further behind 
schedule, until 3 in the afternoon. This turned out quite well because it
gave us time to go to IKEA and have lunch with Josephine, also a distant relative. 
After that we went to see the Mall
of America. The train ended up beinig so late that we had time for dinner
before I had to leave. 

When the train finally arrived in Chicago at 3 in the morning, it was 
11 hours, 25 minutes late. 

Luckily I was able to take advantage of the situation. Amtrak was trying
to appease the passengers who had missed their connecting trains by
providing them with free accomodations and food. I got 30 bucks just by 
talking to one of the people working for Amtrak. Then I was able to
enter the sleeping car lounge, where I slept for free. Then, the
next morning, they served free cinnamon rolls and coffee to everyone in
the lounge. Yet another great place to stay!

I still had a few hours before the California Zephyr was scheduled to
depart, so I took the "L" into The Loop and paid a visit to the 
used bookstore I visited last time. I made some great purchases which
should keep me occupied on the Transsiberian Railroad later this month.
