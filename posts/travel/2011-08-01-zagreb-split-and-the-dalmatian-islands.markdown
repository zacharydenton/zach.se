The train ride down to Croatia was quite nice, especially when we passed
through the mountains in Austria and Slovenia. I arrived rather late in
the evening, so I just went straight to the nearest hostel and went to
sleep. It turns out that it's more difficult to fall asleep on European
trains than it was on Amtrak because there's no lounge car. I'm not a
huge fan of the six person cabin arrangement, either.

The next morning, I set out to explore Zagreb. I walked towards the main
square in the city, passing through a nice park along the way.

I then
continued up the hill towards the cathedral.

After that, I walked
through a neighborhood and up a long staircase to the top of the hill,
where the residents of Zagreb play tennis. I walked back towards the
city.

I walked along a pedestrian avenue with many cafes.

I spent a
while searching for a restaurant called Mali Medo, where I had some
traditional cevapcici. Then I got on the train to Split.

When I arrived In Split the time was around 7 AM. The first thing I
did was explore the Diocletian Palace, the ancient Roman palace that
forms the core of the city.

Walking through there felt like traveling
back in time, with its narrow streets and stone architecture.

I walked
through the Pazar market and eventually found a place to stay.

I left my
bags there, since they wouldn't allow me to check in yet, and headed
west towards Marjan.

Marjan is a large park situated just outside of Split. I hiked up to the
top of the hill, stopping a couple of times to listen to some music I
had been meaning to listen to. The view from the top was decent.

I noticed
there were a few beaches to the South, so I continued walking and
eventually found a narrow path that led down the hill towards the
beaches.

The beaches in Croatia aren't sandy like pretty much every
other beach I had previously been to. Instead, they are composed of
many small pebbles. Although this is less comfotable to lay on than
sand, I actually prefer it because you don't have to worry about sand
getting everywhere. This was especially important for me as I had
recently transitioned from carrying a suitcase half full of books to
carrying the equivalent of a hundred suitcases full of books on my
phone. I went swimming for a while, but unfortunately I didn't have any
sunscreen. I ended up with probably the worst sunburn of my life. Nice water
though, quite relaxing to just float around in.

The next day, I hopped on the ferry towards the island of Brac. Or so I
thought. When I arrived, I realized that I was actually on the island of
Solta. I had taken my suitcase with me as I was planning on spending
the night on Brac, the going to Hvar, then to Korcula, and finally to
Dubrovnik. However, ther were no places to stay on Solta. I ended up
just hauling my suitcase around the whole day. I spent an hour or two
on a nearby beach, and then took the bus to the far side of the island.
I was hoping to sample some Soltan honey (apparently the third best in
the world and the only honey made from rosemary), but I couldn't find it
in any of the stores or markets. It turns out that the honey farm was
located several minutes away from the nearest town (by car) and no buses
went to it. It would have been ideal to rent a moped and explore the
island that way, but that was a bit out of my price range. I made my way
back to the ferry, walking the last few kilometers.

I ended up catching
the ferry right at the last minute.

When I got back to Split, I had to find a new hostel. After walking
around to a few places, I finally found one called the Adriatic Hostel.
This was ideal because it had a kitchen and was located next to two
supermarkets and the Pazar market. The only downsides were the price and
the fact that they had only one knife in the entire kitchen.

The next day, I took the ferry to Brac, making sure that it was the
right one this time. There were a lot of cool things to see on Brac, but
I ended up just spending the whole day on Zlatni Rat beach.
It's an interesting triangle shaped pebble beach.

I reread the first
three books of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series.

After having my usual breakfast of yogurt, fruit, sausage, and some donut-like
Croatian pastries (all for about $4) the next morning, I set off for
Hvar. I spent a while exploring Stari Grad, taking several photos of
the buildings and boats.

![Harbor in Stari Grad](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2pl-mf-5jsk/TiWz1dvxCEI/AAAAAAAAZ_E/lh07hZjSYYo/s1000/IMG_3249.JPG)

I had some sandwiches for dinner and then
started hiking around the island to the place where I thought the boat was
departing from. 

![Hiking Trail on Hvar](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-14pmOFU_1GM/TiW1DznloFI/AAAAAAAAZ_E/N-Aq0PndEzw/s1000/IMG_3253.JPG)

I walked by some interesting rock formations and passed
a nude beach area, eventually reaching a dead end.

I then walked back
towards Stari Grad and, much to my dismay, saw that the boat was
actually coming in on the other side of the town.

I walked quickly
towards the ferry but missed it by about 20 minutes. 

![The ferry departs into the sunset...](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Kdy_UduS52g/TiW5j6wyn-I/AAAAAAAAZ_I/y4rCenUezTA/s1000/IMG_3282.JPG)

Then I just
listened to some music for a couple of hours and watched the sunset from
some rocks on the shoreline.

I made sure to be on time for the final
ferry of the day.

The next day, I took the advice of Irish people I met and
took the train to Lake Bled in Slovenia.
