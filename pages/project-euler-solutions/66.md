## Overview


### Question

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

$$
\begin{align}
x^2-Dy^2=1
\end{align}
$$

For example, when $D=13$, the minimal solution in $x$ is
$6492 – 131802 = 1$.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when
$D$ is square.

By finding minimal solutions in $x$ for $D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}$, we obtain
the following:

$$
\begin{align}
3^2 – 2 \times 2^2 &= 1 \\
2^2 – 3 \times 1^2 &= 1 \\
9^2 – 5 \times 4^2 &= 1 \\
5^2 – 6 \times 2^2 &= 1 \\
8^2 – 7 \times 3^2 &= 1 \\
\end{align}
$$

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in $x$ for $D \leq 7$, the
largest $x$ is obtained when $D=5$.

Find the value of $D \leq 1000$ in minimal solutions of $x$ for which
the largest value of $x$ is obtained.
