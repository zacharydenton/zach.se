## Overview


### Question

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$$F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2} \text{ where } F_1 = 1 \text{ and } F_2 = 1$$

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

$$\begin{aligned}
F_1 &= 1 \\\\
F_2 &= 1 \\\\
F_3 &= 2 \\\\
F_4 &= 3 \\\\
F_5 &= 5 \\\\
F_6 &= 8 \\\\
F_7 &= 13 \\\\
F_8 &= 21 \\\\
F_9 &= 34 \\\\
F_{10} &= 55 \\\\
F_{11} &= 89 \\\\
F_{12} &= 144
\end{aligned}$$

The 12th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?






## Solutions

### Clojure

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env clojure
(def fibs
  (lazy-cat [(BigInteger/ZERO) (BigInteger/ONE)] (map + fibs (rest fibs))))

(println (count (take-while #(< % (.pow (BigInteger/TEN) 999)) fibs)))
```


```
$ time clojure fibonacci.clj
real	0m1.831s
user	0m2.569s
sys	0m0.089s
```



### Haskell

```haskell
fibs ::  [Integer]
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

main ::  IO ()
main = print $ head [i | i <- [1..], (==1000) . length . show $ fibs !! i]
```


```
$ time runhaskell fibonacci.hs
real	0m0.623s
user	0m0.555s
sys	0m0.034s
```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
i = 1
t1, t2 = 0, 1
while t2.to_s.length < 1000
    t1, t2 = t2, t1 + t2
    i += 1
end
puts i
```


```
$ time ruby fibonacci.rb
real	0m0.345s
user	0m0.334s
sys	0m0.010s
```
