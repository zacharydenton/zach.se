I took the [Southwest
Chief](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Chief) train to the Grand
Canyon from Chicago. The views of Colorado and New Mexico
were excellent. We even had an impromptu guitar concert in the
observation car at one point! This was the best train ride so far.

The train stopped in the middle of the night at Williams Junction, Arizona, 
which is essentially in the middle of the woods. No platform or anything. 
Luckily there was a shuttle which  took the three of us brave enough to 
get off there into the town of  Williams, a.k.a. the "Gateway to the Grand 
Canyon". I stayed at the Grand Canyon Hotel, the oldest (and perhaps 
least expensive) hotel in Arizona.

The next morning I looked at a few of the shops on Route 66 (which is
like Main St. in Williams). One of them had a great collection of
Southwest artifacts: bull horns, Native American art, old Route 66
signs, an hot sauce collection which took up an entire room, and quite a
few other odds and ends. I ended up buying a bottle of "Sioux City
Sarsaparilla" root beer. It compared favorably to other root beers I've
tried but I still think the Harpoon root beer from Boston is the best.

The Grand Canyon Railway was an experience in itself. I was expecting
just a peaceful train ride to the Grand Canyon, but they offered quite a
bit more than that. It started off with a cowboy show at 9:00 AM.
Unfortunately the show had to be ended prematurely because everyone was
seeking cover from the snow. I have to admit, I wasn't expecting snow 
at the Grand Canyon in the middle of May.

On the train, we were entertained by some cowboy-musicians playing
harmonica, guitar, and banjo. It was kind of fun but then they started
selling miniature harmonicas for $5. I didn't realize the train to the
Grand Canyon would be such a tourist trap!

Eventually we arrived at the Canyon. It was cold, snowing, and windy,
but despite all this the view of the Grand Canyon was absolutely
breathtaking. I took a brief reprieve from the weather for lunch, but I
was back outside in short order.

You have to walk in a particular way along the rim of the Grand Canyon: take
10 steps, take 10 photos, repeat. I took a ridiculous
amount of photos at the Canyon; it would take an age to process all of
the HDR/panoramic shots I took. I think most photographers will agree
that it's impossible to capture the beauty of the Canyon in a
photograph, however.

The Grand Canyon and essentially everything surrounding it is owned and
managed by one company, Xanterra. I didn't think this seemed like such a
good thing when I heard about it, but there are some nice benefits. For
example, there is a free shuttle system which takes you to several
destinations along the South Rim. Also, your luggage will be
transported from the train to your hotel room for you. It was 
like a miniature example of the benefits of centralized governments.

After lunch I walked into the canyon on the Bright Angel trail. I didn't
go far, but enough to get a different vantage point. I certainly plan on
coming back to hike rim-to-rim.

Then I walked along the "Trail of Time", which ran along the Canyon's
edge. Along the way were rocks extracted from different levels of the
Canyon, and some signs which explained more about what you were seeing.

I don't know if it was the altitude, but along the way I got this really
profound sense of "everything is beautiful" where I would just stop and gaze at the
rocks and trees for several minutes at a time. Having worked as a
computer programmer, I often think of the steps it would take to create
something like a tree. I find it incredible that a seed will eventually
turn into a tree (if certain conditions regarding water and nutrients
are met) which eventually produces more seeds, and that water, wind, and erosion can form such a complex
landscape as the Grand Canyon. It would be amazing if something was able
to design a seed with these properties; it's even more amazing if a seed
like this evolved unguided over billions of years. There's no doubt that
evolution takes place, but it doesn't provide all the
answers. On the other hand, intelligent design is an easy solution, but
even if something set the initial parameters (so to speak), there must be 
something responsible for change. I suppose I'll cut this digression
short; being human I have far more questions than answers.

All in all, the Grand Canyon was wonderful and I hope to return for an
expedition into the Canyon.
