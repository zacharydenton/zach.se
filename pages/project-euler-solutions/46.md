## Overview


### Question

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number
can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

$$\begin{aligned}
9 & = 7 + 2\times1^2 \\
15 & = 7 + 2\times2^2 \\
21 & = 3 + 2\times3^2 \\
25 & = 7 + 2\times3^2 \\
27 & = 19 + 2\times2^2 \\
33 & = 31 + 2\times1^2
\end{aligned}$$

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of
a prime and twice a square?






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from itertools import product

def sieve(n):
    numbers = range(2, n+1)
    p = 2
    j = 0
    done = False
    while not done:
        for i, n in enumerate(numbers):
            if n % p == 0 and n!=p:
                numbers.pop(i)
        j += 1
        p = numbers[j]
        if p**2 > n:
            done = True
    return numbers

def main():
    primes = sieve(10000)
    composites = set(n for n in range(2,10000) if n not in primes)
    twicesquares = set(2*(n**2) for n in range(100))

    sums = set(sum(c) for c in product(primes, twicesquares))
    print min(n for n in composites if n not in sums and n % 2 != 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

$ time pypy composite-prime.py
real	0m0.240s
user	0m0.158s
sys	0m0.026s
```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'set'
require 'mathn'
primes = (2..10000).select { |n| n.prime? }.to_set
composites = (2..10000).reject { |n| n.prime? }.to_set
twicesquares = (0..100).map { |n| 2*(n**2) }.to_set
sums = primes.to_a.product(twicesquares.to_a).map { |a,b| a+b }.to_set
puts composites.select { |n| !sums.include?(n) and n.odd? }.min
```


```
$ time ruby composite-prime.rb
real	0m0.414s
user	0m0.338s
sys	0m0.015s
