My visit to Copenhagen was relatively uneventful. The main thing I did
was go to the [Coffee Collective](http://www.coffeecollective.dk/), a
coffee roastery run by a former World Barista Champion.

I'm not entirely sure what that means. At the Coffee Collective, I tried
a coffee which was blended with bergamot, like Earl Grey tea. It wasn't
very good. When I got back to the US, I searched for different Aeropress
brewing techniques and came across [the technique that Coffee Collective
uses](http://coffeecollective.blogspot.com/2010/01/updated-aeropress-brewing-method.html).
I'm not sure if it really improves the flavor but it is certainly more
complicated.

I also lost my phone charger at the hostel I was staying at. This
effectively doubled the cost of staying at the hostel. I don't
understand how the worst hostel on my trip could be in Copenhagen.

After the short stay in Copenhagen, I went to the airport and hopped on
a plane headed for Iceland.
