## Question

By replacing the 1st digit of *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible 
values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.

By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit 
number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated 
numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 
56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the 
smallest prime with this property.

Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily 
adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.

primes = 2 : sieve primes [3,5..] where
    sieve (p:ps) xs = h ++ sieve ps [x | x <- t, rem x p /= 0]
                      where (h, t) = span (< p*p) xs

isPrime :: Int -> Bool
isPrime n | n < 1 = False
          | otherwise = not $ or [n `rem` x == 0 | x <- [2..floor $ sqrt $ fromIntegral n]]

groupFrequency :: Ord a => [a] -> [(Int, a)]
groupFrequency xs = reverse $ sort [(length cs, head cs) | cs <- group $ sort xs]

candidates :: [(Char, String)]
candidates = [(snd $ head g, s) | p <- primes,
                                  let s = show p,
                                  let g = groupFrequency s,
                                  any ((== 3) . fst) g]

replace :: Eq a => a -> a -> [a] -> [a]
replace old new = foldr (\x acc -> (if x == old then new else x) : acc) []

expand :: (Char, String) -> [String]
expand (d, ds) = [new | n <- ['1'..'9'], let new = replace d n ds, isPrime (read new)]

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn $ snd . head $ filter ((== 8) . length . expand) candidates
