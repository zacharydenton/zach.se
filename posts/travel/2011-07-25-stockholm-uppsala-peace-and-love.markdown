I spent several weeks in Sweden, and I don't remember all of it
(especially the week at Peace and Love), so this will not be as detailed
as previous entries. Overall, it was an excellent time. Out of all the
places I've seen in the world, Sweden still seems like the best place to
live.

Upon arriving at Arlanda airport, I was greeted by Morfar and Lena. I
spent a day or two at their house and then went out to Erikslund for
Midsommar.

Midsommar was great fun. First, we had lunch, with herring and potatoes
among other things. Then we played a game where Lotta would read a few
words of a song and the groups would try to complete
the line. I literally had never heard a single one of the songs she read
out. Then we danced around the Midsommar pole.

Later we had dinner. It
was a good time.

The next day I went to Solna. Erik and I went over to one of his
friends' house and we played a few rounds of poker. At one point I met
up with a friend from Sigtuna, Emmy, for drinks and conversation. She
had a lot of interesting tales from her travels in Southeast Asia.

I took the train out to Rosersberg to meet up with some friends who were
driving up to Borlange for the Peace and Love music festival. We made a
couple of stops for supplies along the way and arrived in Borlange ready
for action.

When we arrived, there were people everywere. Some people were carrying
their tents to the campsite, some people were having lunch, some people
were just sitting around and drinking. We made our way to the campsite
and set up camp.

The people at our campsite were great. Some people came for the music;
some came for the party. Others came for both. We spent the rest of the
evening hanging out and having an excellent time. After a
while, I decided to go and explore some other parts of the camping area.
I met many people, all of them in a great mood. At some point, I
realized that I was utterly lost. But, it all worked out in the end.

Most nights followed a regular pattern: hang out at the campsite for a
while, head out and meet new people, have a wild time, fall asleep
somewhere. I won't go into specifics here.

So, having established that the nights were consistently excellent, I'd
like to talk about some of the music. The first band I saw was Jimmy Eat
World, a band which I have been listening to for a long time.

I wandered into this nightclub-like area where a band called The Amplifetes 
were playing.

They have
a brilliant electro-rock sound which was incredible to experience live.
I've since acquired their album, which is very good.

I also saw a band called Those Dancing Days. I had heard of them, but
neer actually heard them before. It was such a great performance.
Despite the fact that they were playing at the same
time as Bob Dylan, the venue was completely packed.
I've been listening to their first album and it's quite good.

I saw Deadmau5, along with at least 4,000 other dancing, sweaty Swedes.

The word that comes to mind to describe that performance is
'hot'.
Indeed, it was eventually too much for me and I decided to head back to
the camp. On the way I met up with a girl who was camping with us. She
had actually maneuvered her way all the way to the front and touched the
stage. I thought it was too intense about halfway back.... Can't imagine
what the energy level must have been like at the front.

As I was cruising around from stage to stage, I saw a metal band called
Soilwork. At the climax of the concert, the singer called for the "Wall
of Death". The crowd split into two halves and faced each other like
warriors on a battlefield. Then, the singer emitted a primal scream 
which signaled the start of the battle. We rushed toward each other and a
mosh pit erupted at the collision point. Everyone was running
into each other in a frenzy. I'm not normally a fan of metal, but I have
to admit that concert appealed to some ancient part of my brain. I
did lose a couple buttons on my favorite shirt in the process, though.

One of the best bands I saw was also the last band I saw: Foreigner.

My
dad says they were the greatest rock band of 1978. I can definitely see
why. Awesome stage presence, face melting guitar solos, songs that you
recognize but don't know why - to me it was exactly what a true rock n'
roll concert should be like.

A few other things I saw:

* Speech by Jesse Jackson
* Guided meditation session
* Bad Religion
* Social Distortion
* The Strokes
* Bob Dylan
* Journey
* Many, many other good performances

I went back to the camp and did my usual routine. I remember meeting a
girl called Paola Denton whose father is also named Jeff! What are the
cances of that? Eventually it was time to head home, so I hopped in
a car with some people who were heading back. After a while I appeared
in Solna and promptly fell asleep.

I went back to Morfar's and Anna was there. We visited Gamla Uppsala and
the castle, which I hadn't seen before.
We also had dinner with Lollo and her brother at a fantastic Korean restaurant
in Stockholm.

I purchased an Interrail pass and a plane ticket back to the US. I'm
going to be in Iceland for a week or so before getting back to Maryland.
I took the train down to Croatia after bidding everyone
farewell.
