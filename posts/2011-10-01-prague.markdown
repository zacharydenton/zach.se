I spent a couple days in Prague. Here I found some of the most
impressive Gothic architecture I've ever seen - it looked straight out
of The Lord of the Rings.

Inspired by the Canadian I met in Budapest, I planned to stay at the
cheapest hostel in Prague. It seemed like a pretty good place when I
looked at their website in Vienna, although it's situated well outside
of the city center. As usual, I decided not to book in advance because
it seemed unnecessary.

After arriving in Prague, I walked for a while and eventually reached
the hostel. It was of course fully booked when I arrived. They told me
about a place even farther away from the city center called "Vibe
Hotel". This was the only hostel/hotel on my trip that had a swimming
pool. The people at this place were quite different from the usual
hostel crowd of seasoned travelers. Mostly they were fresh college grads
looking to party.

The next day I went for a great walk around the city.

First, I made the long trek from the hotel to the main square. The
square was filled with people admiring the buildings and enjoying the
weather.

After a brief lunch break, I walked across the bridge and up cobblestone
streets to Prague Castle.

I explored the castle for a while, especially impressed by the
cathedral.

I then crossed the river and walked alongside it until I completed the
walking loop. I had some Chinese food for dinner and went to Berlin the
next day.
