When I got off the train in Moscow, I was desperately in need of some
coffee and real food. I was also completely lost, so I needed to find an
internet connection. Luckily, and somewhat surprisingly, there were free
WiFi hotspots throughout the city. Eventually I found a cafe and
a hostel to stay at.

The hostel was very nice and extremely well situated. It was located
inside of an expensive apartment near Arbat Street. By the time I
had checked in, it was already around 7 PM.

I decided to check out Old Arbat Street, which is a touristy pedestrian
street in the center of the city. I was amused to see an old man sitting
in front of a chessboard, confidently taking on all challengers. There
were also several used book stalls, but they didn't appear to have
anything worth reading.

I had a couple of slices of pizza at Sbarro, of
all places. I wanted to try some traditional Russian food but the
Western alternatives were quite simply much cheaper.

Despite having traveled to Moscow by train, I was still not fully
adjusted to the timezone. Consequently, I awoke at around 5 AM. This
turned out to be a very good thing, however.

After having some
breakfast, I made my way to the Red Square, which was not yet crowded by
the daily surge of tourists.

It was also brilliantly lit by the morning
sun.

I took several pictures of the beautiful Russian architecture.

In Moscow, the architects weren't content with just making the surface
beautiful: the
subway stations are also lavishly decorated, albeit extremely crowded.

I proceeded to explore some more of Moscow.

I walked through several
neighborhoods in search of a subway station.
When I
found an open wireless network, I was able to orientate myself using Google Maps.
Then I walked to the nearest subway station and took the subway to the
theater. When I got there, at least 30 people were skateboarding at the
nearby fountain.

That really made me look forward to some longboarding
when I get back to Maryland. 

Across the street was a statue of Karl
Marx.

Later, I took the subway to the VDNKh, or "Exhibition of Achievements of
the National Economy".

It's a park with pavilions for each
republic of the former Soviet Union.

It also had a few ornate
fountains.

Near the end of the park was an impressive Soviet rocket.

The afternoon light was excellent for taking photos. It seems that the
best time to take pictures is either during the morning or during the
evening, when the angle of the sun produces some dramatic
highlights and shadows.

The next day I explored another part of the city for a while. After a
couple of hours, it started
to rain, so I went back to the hostel. 

Eventually I took the train out to the airport and hopped on the plane
to Stockholm.
