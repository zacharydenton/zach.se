## Overview


### Question

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each
of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible
by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?





## Commentary

The critical insight of this problem is this:

$$divisibleto(x) = n \times divisibleto(x-1)$$

This means that when searching for the smallest number divisible to 20,
we can increment by the smallest number divisible to 19 each time (since the 
smallest number divisible to 19 is inherently a factor of the smallest number
divisible to 20).

This insight is used in the python solution on line 14:

	step = divisible_to(x-1)

This is a recursive solution to the problem, and yields incredible performance. It can calculate
the smallest number divisible to 500 in a fraction of a second.



## Solutions

### Haskell

```haskell
isDivisibleTo ::  Integer -> Integer -> Bool
isDivisibleTo x n = all (\i -> n `mod` i == 0) (reverse [1..x])

divisibleTo ::  Integer -> Integer
divisibleTo 1 = 1
divisibleTo x = let step = divisibleTo (x-1)
                in  head $ filter (isDivisibleTo x) [step,2*step..]

main ::  IO ()
main = print $ divisibleTo 20
```


```
$ time runhaskell divisible.hs
real	0m0.255s
user	0m0.214s
sys	0m0.039s
```



### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
def is_divisible_to(number, x):
    for i in reversed(range(1, x+1)):
        if number % i != 0:
            return False
    return True

def divisible_to(x):
    if x < 1:
        return False
    elif x == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        step = divisible_to(x-1)
        number = 0
        found = False
        while not found:
            number += step
            found = is_divisible_to(number, x)
        return number

print divisible_to(20)
```


```
$ time pypy divisible.py
real	0m0.050s
user	0m0.035s
sys	0m0.014s
```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

class Numeric
  def divisible_to?(x)
    self > 0 and x.downto(1).all? { |i| self % i == 0 }
  end
end

def divisible_to(x)
  if x < 1
    return false
  elsif x == 1
    return 1
  else
    n = 0
    step = divisible_to(x-1)
    until n.divisible_to? x
      n += step
    end
    return n
  end
end

puts divisible_to(20)
```


```
$ time ruby divisible.rb
real	0m0.017s
user	0m0.013s
sys	0m0.003s
