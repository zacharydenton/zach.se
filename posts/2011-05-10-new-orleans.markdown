I spent the last few days in New Orleans for Jazz Fest.
Everything about it was awesome - great food, great music, great times.

My train arrived Wednesday night around 9:00 PM. After exiting the train
station, I was greeted by a shady fellow offering to
show me the way to my hotel. He asked what I was doing in New Orleans,
and I told him I was there for Jazz Fest. At that point he withdrew
a large bag of cannabis from his pocket and asked if I wanted
to buy some. I told him I wasn't interested and he went on his way. 

After checking in at the hotel, I decided to see what was happening at
Bourbon Street. Nobody seemed to mind that it was Wednesday night.
Normally that would be pretty cool, but this is the U.S. and you have to
be 21 to get in anywhere (if you're a guy). Not even the Irish pub let
me in. Finally I found an oyster bar off the beaten path and
had a nice fried oyster po'boy.

The next morning, my dad and I walked through the French Quarter to Jazz
Fest. Along the way we met some lady who had been going to Jazz Fest for
something like 10 years in a row. She told us that she preferred to
start the day off by going to the Bloody Mary bar. My dad agreed that it
sounded like a pretty good idea, so we set off to find it. Sadly, it
wasn't there this year.

After walking for quite a while, we arrived at the fest. The first thing
we did was grab something to eat. Let me tell you, there was no shortage
of food at Jazz Fest. There were long rows of kiosks each serving their
own Louisiana specialities. Crawfish, gumbo, boudin, jambalaya, barbeque... 
basically all the Cajun/Creole cuisine you could ask for.

The best part, though, was the music. I was pleased to see a variety of
genres represented at Jazz Fest. They have around 12 different stages
set up, each with its own feel. The most crowded stages were the Acura
Stage and the Gentilly Stage, which hosted more mainstream artists
like Willie Nelson and Jimmy Buffett. Then you have the Blues Tent, Jazz
Tent, and Gospel Tent, which offered great music and a nice refuge from
the Louisiana sun. The Fais Do Do Stage was the domain of more
traditional Cajun artists, like D.L. Menard. World music artists like 
RAM of Haiti played at Congo Square. I'm not really sure what went on at
the other stages because I didn't have time to check them out.

My favorite performances:

1. Michael Franti & Spearhead
2. Wilco
3. Anders Osborne
4. Better Than Ezra
5. Christian Scott

It was a great music festival and I hope to return sometime.

Right now I'm sitting at the airport in Nashville waiting for a flight
to Chicago. Originally I was supposed to take the "City of New Orleans" Amtrak train 
to Chicago, but due to the flooding of the Mississippi the train was cancelled. 
Luckily, I was able to get a ride to the airport in Nashville (thanks again!).
